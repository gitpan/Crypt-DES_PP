	* DES_PP.ppm: Bumped version number to 0.06.

	* test.pl:
	Eval dependencies to other modules in single quotes, not in curly
	braces to avoid the test to fail if Crypt::CBC is not present.

	* t/cbcref.t:
	Don't print a test number for bulk output when Crypt::CBC is not
	present, so that Test::Harness doesn't get confused.

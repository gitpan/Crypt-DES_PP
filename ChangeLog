2000-10-23  Guido Flohr  <guido@freemint.de>

	* MANIFEST: Renamed DES_PP.ppm to DES_PP.ppp.

	* DES_PP.ppp: Bumped version number to 0.07.
	Renamed DES_PP.ppm to DES_PP.ppp.

	* DES_PP.ppm, Makefile.PL:
	Renamed DES_PP.ppm (oops, used by Activestate Perl) to DES_PP.ppp
	(like pre-process perl).
	Makefile now retrieves version information directly from DES_PP.ppp.
	Filter out preprocessor line numbers from output so that Perl reports
	linenumbers correctly when a warning or error occurs.

	* DES_PP.ppm:
	Fixed typo/thinko (don't remember) in crypt().  Should now run
	on big-endian machines, too.  Thanks to schinder@pobox.com for
	the bug report, thanks to Frank Naumann (fnaumann@freemint.de)
	for giving me access to his big-endian MiNT machine for debugging.

	* DES_PP.ppm: Bumped version number to 0.06.

	* test.pl:
	Eval dependencies to other modules in single quotes, not in curly
	braces to avoid the test to fail if Crypt::CBC is not present.

	* t/cbcref.t:
	Don't print a test number for bulk output when Crypt::CBC is not
	present, so that Test::Harness doesn't get confused.

NAME
    Crypt::DES_PP - Perl extension for DES encryption

SYNOPSIS
    use Crypt::DES_PP;

        $des = Crypt::DES_PP->new ($key);
        $cipher = $des->encrypt ($plain);
        $plain = $des->decrypt ($cipher);
        $blocksize = $des->blocksize;
        $keysize = $des->keysize;

DESCRIPTION
    The Data Encryption Standard (DES), also known as Data
    Encryption Algorithm (DEA) is a semi-strong encryption and
    decryption algorithm.

    The module is 100 % compatible to Crypt::DES but is implemented
    entirely in Perl. That means that you do not need a C compiler
    to build and install this extension.

    The module implements the Crypt::CBC interface. You are
    encouraged to read the documentation for Crypt::CBC if you
    intend to use this module for Cipher Block Chaining.

    The minimum (and maximum) key size is 8 bytes. Shorter keys will
    cause an exception, longer keys will get silently truncated.
    Data is encrypted and decrypted in blocks of 8 bytes.

    The module implements the Ultra-Fast-Crypt (UFC) algorithm as
    found for example in the GNU libc. On the Perl side a lot has
    been done in order to make the module as fast as possible
    (function inlining, use integer, ...).

    Note: For performance issues the source code for the module is
    first preprocessed by m4. That means that you need an m4 macro
    processor in order to hack on the sources. This is of no concern
    for you if you only want to use the module, the preprocessed
    output is always included in the distribution.

BUGS
    Nothing known. The module has not been tested on 64 bit
    architectures.

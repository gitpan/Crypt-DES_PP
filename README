This is a pure Perl implementation of the DES algorithm, aka DEA.
It's interface is identical to that of Crypt::DES.  You can therefore
use it as a plug-in replacement for Crypt::DES.

Try ``perldoc lib/Crypt/DES_PP.pm'' (before installation and from
this directory) or ``perldoc Crypt::DES_PP'' (after installation)
to learn more about the module.

Have fun with it.
